# Text Summarization

This project implements two types of text summarization techniques:

- **Extractive summarization** using the TextRank algorithm via the `sumy` library.
- **Abstractive summarization** using the `t5-small` Transformer model from Hugging Face.

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

- `transformers`
- `sumy`
- `torch`
